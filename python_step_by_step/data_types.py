#Python is capable of handling a wide variety of data types.
#The most common data types are:
#Numbers (integers, floating point numbers) + examples

#Strings + examples
first_name ="Gad"

#Lists + examples
my_list = [1,2,3,4,5]

#Tuples + examples
my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)

#Dictionaries + examples
my_dict = {"name":"Gad","age":25}

#Booleans + examples
my_bool = True

#None + examples
my_none = None

#Path: operators.py
#Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
#Python divides the operators in the following groups:
#Arithmetic operators
#Assignment operators
#Comparison operators
#Logical operators
#Identity operators
#Membership operators
#Bitwise operators


#Arithmetic operators + examples
#Addition
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)

#Subtraction
x = 5
y = 3
print(x - y)

#Multiplication
x = 5
y = 3
print(x * y)

#Division
x = 5
y = 3
print(x / y)

#Modulus
x = 5
y = 3
print(x % y)


#Assignment operators + examples
#Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand
x = 5
y = 3
print(x + y)

#Add AND
x = 5
y = 3
x += y
print(x)

#Subtract AND
x = 5
y = 3
x -= y
print(x)

#Multiply AND
x = 5
y = 3
x *= y
print(x)

#Divide AND
x = 5
y = 3
x /= y
print(x)

#Modulus AND
x = 5
y = 3
x %= y
print(x)

#Comparison operators + examples
#Equal
x = 5
y = 3
print(x == y)

#Not equal
x = 5
y = 3
print(x != y)

#Greater than
x = 5
y = 3
print(x > y)

#Less than
x = 5
y = 3
print(x < y)

#Greater than or equal to
x = 5
y = 3
print(x >= y)

#Less than or equal to
x = 5
y = 3
print(x <= y)

#Logical operators + examples
#And
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10)

#Or
x = 5
print(x > 3 or x < 4)

#Not
x = 5
print(not(x > 3 and x < 10))

#Identity operators + examples
#Is
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x
print(x is z)

#Is not
x = ["apple", "banana"]
y = ["apple", "banana"]
z = x
print(x is not z)

#Membership operators + examples
#In
x = ["apple", "banana"]
print("banana" in x)

#Not in
x = ["Zvulun", "Gad", "Asher"]
print("Zvulun" not in x)

#Bitwise operators + examples
#Bitwise AND
x = 10
y = 4
print(x & y)

#Bitwise OR
x = 10
y = 4
print(x | y)

#Bitwise NOT
x = 10
print(~x)

#Bitwise XOR
x = 10
y = 4
print(x ^ y)

#Bitwise right shift
x = 10
print(x >> 2)

#Bitwise left shift
x = 10
print(x << 2)
